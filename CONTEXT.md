## Known Issues

### Active Bugs

## Notes for AI Assistants

### Current Session Context
We're improving the AI-assisted development workflow by adding:
1. Better documentation structure (AGENTS.md, CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Quick reference guides (COMMON_TASKS.md, GLOSSARY.md)
3. Validation and debugging utilities
4. Test scenarios for automated validation

### What's Working Well
- MCP-based remote control is reliable
- Physics simulation is stable (except frame 20 edge case)
- Code-driven scene generation enables good version control
- Type hints provide excellent IDE support

### What Needs Improvement
- Error messages could be more contextual
- Physics debugging is still manual
- No automated scene validation yet
- Testing requires manual inspection

### Preferred Patterns
- Use `ensure_material()` pattern for materials
- Use `clear_existing_*()` before creating components
- Always check `bpy.context.active_object` for None
- Use collection-based organization
- Add emoji indicators for user feedback (‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÑ)

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't use `if __name__ == "__main__"` in Blender scripts
- Don't assume `bpy.context.active_object` is not None
- Don't hardcode file paths (use environment variables)
- Don't skip `clear_scene.py` at start of pipeline
- Don't ignore physics timing (frame order matters)
